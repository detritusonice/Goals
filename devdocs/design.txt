Goals design document
created on 16/sept/2018

application behavior:
	character-based, menu driven application prototype
	looping a display, input, process cycle
	handling Goal object records, stored in an XML file and memory
	offering insertion, deletion, modification, and sorting based on attrib

Behaviour stages:
	Display:
		a) any output resulting from the immediately previous user input
		b) menu or submenu line below aforesaid output.
	Input:
		accepting character based commands or data according to the 
		current state of the application regarding user choices 
		and actions. 
		Error checking permeates all user input except individual record entries.
	Process:
		State machine state changes may be issued followng user input
		Data handling will be issued when user has completed an appropriate
			command sequence for insertion, deletion, modification
			or selection of sorting criterion.
		File operations will follow a "save" user command, or app startup and shutdown.
	Permanend Data Storage:
		An XML file will initially be used to store goals and user selected options
			such as sorting criterion.
Key components:
	XML parser
	XML recorder
	Memory storage and indexing
	line editor
	screen display system.
